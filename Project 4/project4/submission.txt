Brief description to see the story in action:
- Go to any user's Detail page. In the "Usage" section you will see:
  - Most Recent photo: thumbnail + upload date.
  - Most Commented photo: thumbnail + comments count.
- Clicking either thumbnail navigates to the user's Photos view with that photo visible (and comments shown).
- Back end: GET /user/:id/highlights returns mostRecent and mostCommented; front end consumes it via fetchUserHighlights.

Story points: 6

- Select a user to insert a structured @mention. Only existing users can be selected; invalid users cannot be @mentioned.
- Post the comment. The backend extracts and stores mention user IDs with the photo.

-------------------------------------------------- Real-Time Updates using Sockets --------------------------------------------------

Chosen story for real-time updates: 6 - Photo "like" votes (10 points)
Behavior:
- When any user clicks Like/Unlike on a photo, the like count updates in real-time for all users currently viewing the page without refresh.
Implementation notes:
- socket.io broadcasts like updates: { photoId, likesCount, userId, liked }.
- The client listens and updates the TanStack Query cache (`photosOfUser(:id)`) so button state and count update instantly.
